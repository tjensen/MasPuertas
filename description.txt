[quote=jest]This mod is open source, feel free to repack it or do as you will. All I ask is that if you are using the mod inside your own or picking it apart to learn from it, please throw out some shoutouts. Many brilliant minds other than my own are the only reason I am here with all of this anyway, what you see is the culmination of group effort, knowledge, and sharing. If you wanna customize anything that isn't already provided with the config buzz me and I'll see if I can throw you a hand.[/quote]
